# Architecture

Status: planned. This document must be updated in the same activity that changes an architectural contract.

## Design constraints

The production implementation targets Lua 5.4 with 64-bit integers. Driver, BSON, wire protocol, SDAM, CMAP, selection, retry, and transaction behavior are pure Lua. A coroutine-aware runtime interface isolates clocks, cancellation, tasks, locks, sockets, TLS, entropy, hashing, HMAC, and PBKDF2. The supported default adapter is Copas 4.11 with LuaSocket, LuaSec, and an OpenSSL-backed crypto module.

The public entry point is `require("mongodb")`. Modules and functions use `snake_case`; stateful public values use colon methods. Operational APIs return `value` on success or `nil, err` on failure. Structured errors have stable categories, codes, labels, causal chains, and server details. Programmer misuse and broken internal invariants may raise.

## Planned layers

1. **Values:** ordered documents, tagged BSON values, exact numeric handling, codec limits, and Extended JSON.
2. **Runtime:** coroutine scheduling, monotonic time, cancellation/deadlines, locks, exact socket I/O, TLS, and crypto capabilities.
3. **Protocol:** message framing, OP_MSG, command encoding, authentication conversations, and reply/error conversion.
4. **Topology:** immutable server/topology descriptions, SDAM transitions, monitoring, selection, connection pools, and wait queues.
5. **Execution:** command lifecycle, sessions, retries, transactions, CSOT, monitoring, and cursor cleanup.
6. **API:** clients, databases, collections, cursors, concerns, preferences, CRUD, bulk, and administration.
7. **Conformance:** unified entities, requirements, event matching, fake services, schema validation, fixture classification, and reporting.

Dependencies point downward. API objects do not call Copas, LuaSocket, LuaSec, or OpenSSL directly; they depend on runtime and protocol interfaces. The same boundary supports deterministic unit fakes.

## Command data flow

A public operation validates options, creates an operation context and deadline, selects a server, checks out a connection, applies session/transaction fields, encodes OP_MSG, performs exact deadline-aware I/O, decodes and classifies the response, emits monitoring events, updates session state, and returns a value or structured error. Cleanup is deterministic on every branch.

## Test architecture

Each activity starts with a focused red test. Unit tests use fake clocks, sockets, and topology inputs. Integration tests exercise supported MongoDB 7.0–8.2 deployments. The unified runner consumes the pinned specification repository and reports every fixture as passed, failed, or explicitly deferred with a reason; unknown operations are failures. Release gates include packaging smoke tests, linting, the supported Lua/runtime matrix, and strict roadmap validation.

## Intentional exclusions

Version 1 stops at standalone and replica-set production core. Post-v1 activities cover change streams, GridFS, SRV/TXT, compression, sharding, load balancing, client bulk write, additional authentication, logging, telemetry, and backpressure. Client-side field-level/queryable encryption and GSSAPI remain outside the roadmap until separately designed.
